# [CS3310]Compiler Design Lab: Week-1

## Navigate to a subdirectory for a particular question and use these commands:
    1. Use 'make' command to create 'lex.yy.c' file and an executable file called 'scanner'.
    2. The input to the executable can be given through "./scanner.out file_name" (for linux) or "scanner file_name" (for windows).
    3. The command "make clean" can be used to remove both lex.yy.c and scanner files.
