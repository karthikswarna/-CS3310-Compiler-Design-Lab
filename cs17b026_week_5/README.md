# [CS3310]Compiler Design Lab: Week-5 

## I. Use the following commands:
    1. Use 'make' command to create 'scanner' executable file.
    2. The input to the executable can be given through "./scanner file_name" (for linux).
    3. The command "make clean" can be used to remove scanner, lex.yy.c and intermediate files.

## II. Both multiline and single line comments were removed and processed code is stored in another file called "out.c".

### NOTE: Problem description can be found in `Lab5.pdf`.
